What do we want to analyze about movies?

The goal is to provide data for an action movie producer to create the highest rated, most profitable movie possible

Pitching to: Action Movie Producer

1. analyze the number of explosions 
	a. compare number of explosions, budget, gross revenue, and net revenue to determine the best number of explosions for a profitable movie

2. analyze actors who've acted in the most action movies and compare number of appearances to the revenue/profit of those movies

3. analyze ratings vs. revenue

4.  Film location

types of analysts 
1. return on investment 
	a. locations
	b. actors
	c. movie features (explosions)
	d. runtime
	e. pitch genres
We need to merge all data into the smallest by movie title, so that only the ones in that dataset are analyzed
